            <p>I have been programming for about a year, currently I have multiple open source projects on my github. But I have accomplished more then what is listed there. I excel in C++, but can easily work with other languages. I have console projects on my github which show my ability to create applications that can automate something or do something that would be useful for a user. I am very comfortable making scripts and enjoy it. I am also very comfortable with HTML and CSS. Currently I don't have many large scale projects, but I will change that very soon because I am very confident in my ability to handle a large scale project.</p>
